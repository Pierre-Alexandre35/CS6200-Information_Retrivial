n fact, I, uh, was also thinking
about our agreement
about me staying on another season?
And if these new droids do work out,
I want to transmit my application
to the academy this year.
You mean the next semester before the harvest?
Sure. There's more than enough droids.
Harvest is when I need you the most.
It's only one season more.
This year we'll make enough on the harvest
that I'll be able to hire more hands
and then you can
go to the academy next year.
You must understand I need you here, Luke.
But it's a whole 'nother year!
Look, it's only one more season.
Yeah, that's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.
Where are you going?
Looks like I'm going nowhere.
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.
It means so much to him.
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Ooh!
What are you doing hiding back there?
It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.
Kept babbling on about his mission.
Oh, no.
That R2 unit has always
been a problem.
These astro droids
are getting quite out of hand.
Even I can't understand their logic at times.
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.
Blast it!
Pardon me, sir,
but couldn't we go after him?
It's too dangerous
with all the Sandpeople around.
We'll have to wait until morning.
Uncle Owen:
Luke! I'm shutting the power down.
All right! I'll be there in a few minutes.
Boy, am I gonna get it.
That little droid's going to
cause me a lotta trouble.
Oh, he excels at that, sir.
Come on.
Luke?
Luke!
Have you seen Luke this morning?
He said he had some things to do
before he started today,
so he left early.
Did he take
those two new droids with him?
I think so.
Well, he better have those units in the south range
repaired by midday, or there'll be hell to pay.
Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator!
[Speaking Alien Language]
Hey, whoa! Where do you think you're going?
[Beep Beep Beep]
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.
[Beep]
And don't talk to me of your mission, either.
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here!
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.
[Whistle Whistle]
What's wrong with him now?
There are several creatures approaching
from the southeast.
Sandpeople, or worse.
Come on. Let's go have a look.
Come on!
Well, there are two banthas down there,
but I don't see any... Wait a second.
They're Sandpeople, all right.
I can see one of them now.
[Beep Whistle]
[Beep Beep]
[Howl]
Hello, there.
[Beep Blip]
Come here, my little friend. Don't be afraid.
[Beep Blip Blip]
Oh, don't worry. He'll be all right.
Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.
Ben?
Ben Kenobi?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
The Jundland Wastes are not
to be traveled lightly.
[Beep Beep]
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?
This little droid.
[Blip Blip]
I think he's searching for his former master,
but I've never seen such devotion
in a droid before.
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?
Obi-Wan Kenobi?
Obi-Wan.
Now, that's a name I've not
heard in a long time.
A long time.
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.
Oh, he's not dead.
Not yet.
You know him?
Well, of course I know him. He's me.
[Beep Beep]
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan
since, oh, before you were born.
Well, then the droid does belong to you.
I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.
Very interesting.
[Growling]
I think we better get indoors.
The Sandpeople are easily startled,
but they'll soon be back,
and in greater numbers.
[Beep]
3 PO.
Where am I? I must have taken a bad step.
Can you stand?
We've got to get out of here
before the Sandpeople return.
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.
There's no sense
in you risking yourself on my account.
I'm done for.
No, you're not.
What kind of talk is that?
Quickly. They're on the move.
No, my father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
That's what your uncle told you.
He didn't hold
with your father's ideals.
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.
You fought in the Clone Wars?
Yes. I was once a Jedi knight,
the same as your father.
I wish I'd known him.
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy
and a cunning warrior.
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.
And he was a good friend.
Which reminds me,
I have something here for you.
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough,
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some
damn-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.
Sure. Go ahead.
What is it?
It's your father's lightsaber.
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.
Not as clumsy
or random as a blaster.
An elegant weapon
for a more civilized age.
For over a thousand generations,
the Jedi knights were the guardians
of peace and justice in the old Republic,
before the dark times,
before the Empire.
How did my father die?
A young Jedi named Darth Vader,
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil,
helped the Empire
hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights.
He betrayed and murdered your father.
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.
The Force?
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.
It's an energy field created
by all living things.
It surrounds us, penetrates us,
it binds the galaxy together.
[Beep Blip Blip Beep]
Now let's see if we can't
figure out what you are, my little friend,
and where you come from.
I saw part of a message he was...
I seem to have found it.
General Kenobi, years ago
you served my father in the Clone Wars.
Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.
I regret that I am unable to present my
father's request to you in person.
But my ship has fallen under attack,
and I am afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.
I have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion
into the memory systems of this R2 unit.
My father will know how to retrieve it.
You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.
This is our most desperate hour.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan.
I've got to get home.
It's late. I'm in for it as it is.
I need your help, Luke. She needs your help.
I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
I can't get involved.
I've got work to do.
It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it,
but there's nothing
I can do about it right now.
It's all such a long way from here.
That's your uncle talking.
My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?
Learn about the Force, Luke.
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
You can get a transport
there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
You must do what you feel is right, of course.
Until this battle station
is fully operational,
we are vulnerable.
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
They're more dangerous than you realize.
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander,
not to this battle station.
The rebellion will continue to gain support
in the Imperial Senate-
The Imperial Senate will no longer be
of any concern to us.
I have just received word that the emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.
That's impossible.
How will the emperor
maintain control without the bureaucracy?
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.
Fear will keep the local systems in line-
fear of this battle station.
And what of the rebellion?
If the rebels have obtained
a complete technical readout of this station,
it is possible, however unlikely,
that they might
find a weakness and exploit it.
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.
Any attack made by the rebels
against this station would be a useless gesture,
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.
I suggest we use it.
Don't be too proud of this technological terror
you've constructed.
The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
Don't try to frighten us
with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
Your sad devotion to that ancient religion
hasn't helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortre-
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
Enough of this. Vader, release him.
As you wish.
This bickering is pointless.
Lord Vader will provide us
with the location of the rebel fortress
by the time this station is operational.
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.
It looks like the Sandpeople
did this, all right.
Look. There's gaffi sticks,
bantha tracks.
It's just, I've never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.
They didn't,
but we are meant to think they did.
These tracks are side-by-side.
Sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.
And these blast points,
too accurate... for Sandpeople.
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughterJawas?
If they traced the robots here,
they may have learned who they sold them to,
and that would lead them back... home!
Wait, Luke!
It's too dangerous!
Uncle Owen!
Aunt Beru!
Uncle Owen!
And now, Your Highness,
we will discuss the location
of your hidden rebel base.
There's nothing you could have done, Luke,
had you been there.
You'd have been killed, too,
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.
I want to come with you to Alderaan.
There's nothing for me here now.
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.
Mos Eisley spaceport.
You will never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy.
We must be cautious.
[Chattering]
[Braying]
How long have you had these droids?
Three or four seasons.
They're up for sale if you want them.
Let me see your identification.
You don't need to see his identification.
We don't need to see his identification.
These aren't the droids you're looking for.
These aren't the droids we're looking for.
He can go about his business.
You can go about your business.
Move along.
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures!
Go on, go on.
I can't understand how we got by those troops.
I thought we were dead.
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.
Do you really think we're gonna find
a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here,
only watch your step.
This place can be a little rough.
I'm ready for anything.
Come along, R2.
[Alien Lounge Music Plays]
[Laughter]
Hey! We don't serve their kind here.
What?
Your droids, they'll have to wait outside.
We don't want them here.
Why don't you wait out by the speeder?
We don't want any trouble.
I heartily agree with you, sir.
Uh...
I'll have one of those.
[Speaking Alien Language]
He doesn't like you.
I'm sorry.
I don't like you, either.
You just watch yourself.
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.
I'll be careful.
You'll be dead!
This little one's not worth the effort.
Come, let me get you something.
Aah!
I'm all right.
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.
I don't like the look of this.
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for
passage to the Alderaan system.
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.
Fast ship? You've never heard
of the Millennium Falcon?
Should I have?
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.
I've outrun imperial starships.
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.
I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.
She's fast enough for you, old man.
What's the cargo?
Only passengers... myself, the boy,
two droids,
and no questions asked.
What is it, some kind of local trouble?
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
