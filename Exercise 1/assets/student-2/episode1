For none now live who remember it.
It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.
Three were given to the Elves.:
Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.
Seven to the Dwarf-lords.:
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.
And nine...
...nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...
...who, above all else, desire power.
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.
But they were all of them deceived.
For another ring was made.
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...
...the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...
...to control all others.
And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...
...and his will to dominate all life.
One Ring to rule them all.
One by one...
...the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.
But there were some who resisted.
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.
Victory was near.
But the power of the Ring...
...could not be undone.
It was in this moment...
...when all hope had faded...
...that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.
The Ring passed to Isildur...
...who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.
But the hearts of Men...
...are easily corrupted.
And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.
It betrayed Isildur to his death.
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...
...were lost.
History became legend...
...legend became myth.
And for
two and a half thousand years...
...the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.
Until, when chance came...
...it ensnared a new bearer.
My precious.
The Ring came to the creature
Gollum...
...who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.
And there it consumed him.
It came to me.
My own. My love. My own.
My precious.
The Ring brought to Gollum
unnatural long life.
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.
Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...
...whispers of a nameless fear.
And the Ring of Power perceived...
...its time had now come.
It abandoned Gollum.
But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.
What's this?
A Hobbit.
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.
A ring.
Lost!
My precious is lost!
For the time will soon come...
...when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.
The Shire...60 years later
Down from the door where it began
And I must follow if I can
The road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began
Nowfar ahead the road has gone
-And I must follow if I can
-You're late.
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?
What news of the outside world?
Tell me everything.
Everything? You're far too eager
and curious for a Hobbit.
Most unnatural.
Well, what can I tell you?
Life in the wide world goes on
much as it has this past Age.
Full of its own comings and goings.
Scarcely aware of the existence
of Hobbits.
For which I am very thankful.
It's Gandalf!
The long-expected party.
How is the old rascal?
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.
Well, that should please him.
-Half the Shire's been invited.
-Gracious me.
-He's up to something.
-Oh, really?
All right, then. Keep your secrets.
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.
Indeed.
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.
Oh, really?
Gandalf! Gandalf!
Fireworks, Gandalf!
-Gandalf!
-Fireworks, Gandalf!
Gandalf?
-I'm glad you're back.
-So am l, dear boy.
So am I.
No, thank you!
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!
And what about very old friends?
Gandalf?
-Bilbo Baggins.
-My dear Gandalf!
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?
You haven't aged a day.
Come on, come in!
Welcome, welcome.
Oh, here we are.
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?
Just tea, thank you.
I was expecting you sometime
last week.
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart....
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.
I've just found some sponge cake.
I could make you some eggs
if you'd--
-Just tea, thank you.
-Oh, right.
-You don't mind if I eat, do you?
-No, not at all.
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
I'm not at home!
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...
...never giving me a moment's peace.
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.
-So you mean to go through with your plan?
-Yes, yes. It's all in hand.
All the arrangements are made.
Oh, thank you.
Frodo suspects something.
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.
You will tell him, won't you?
-Yes, yes.
-He's very fond of you.
I know.
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.
The woods, the fields.
Little rivers.
I am old, Gandalf.
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.
I feel thin.
Sort of stretched...
...like butter scraped
over too much bread.
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.
And I don't expect I shall return.
In fact, I mean not to.
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.
Gandalf, my old friend...
...this will be a night to remember.
Hello, hello.
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.
-I think I'll just have another ale.
-Oh, no, you don't.
Go on!
So there I was...
...at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...
...about howthey were
going to cook us.
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...
...and turned them all to stone!
Quickly.
Up they go!
No, the big one.
-Done!
-You're supposed to stick it in the ground.
-It is in the ground.
-Outside!
This was your idea.
Watch out for the dragon!
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.
-That was good.
-Let's get another one.
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.
I might've known.
Speech, Bilbo!
Speech!
Speech!
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...
...Tooks and Brandybucks...
...Grubbs, Chubbs...
...Hornblowers...
...Bolgers...
...Bracegirdles...
-...and Proudfoots.
-Proudfeet!
Today is my 111th birthday!
Happy birthday!
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...
...such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.
I have things to do.
I've put this off far too long.
I regret to announce this is the end!
I'm going now.
I bid you all a very fond farewell.
Goodbye.
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.
It was just a bit of fun.
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.
-You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
-Two eyes.
As often as I can spare them.
-I'm leaving everything to him.
-What about this ring of yours?
-Is that staying too?
-Yes, yes.
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.
No. Wait, it's...
...here in my pocket.
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?
Yet, after all, why not?
-Why shouldn't I keep it?
-I think you should leave the ring behind.
Is that so hard?
Well, no.
And yes.
Now it comes to it,
