You cannot pass!
-Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udn!
You shall not pass!
No! No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.
It's not natural. None of it.
-What's in this?
-Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we were having
a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?!
You never know.
Sam. My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elves rope.
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam. . .
. . .but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
-What food have we got left?
-Let me see.
Oh, yes. Lovely.
Lembas bread. And look!
More Lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food. . .
. . .but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
-Can you smell it?
-Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves. The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before. . .
. . . haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
-Take it off us!
-Quiet, you!
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.
-Let's just tie him up and leave him.
-No!
That would kill us! Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.
We swears. . .
. . .to serve the master
of the precious.
We will swear on. . .
. . .on the precious.
Gollum. Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes. . .
. . .on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
-Get down! I said, down!
-Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.
-You know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.
Hey! Come back now! Come back!
There! What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry? Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water. Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
-Leave him alone!
-Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
-You're hurt.
-I'm fine.
-It was just an act.
-An act?
See? I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it? What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food. No rest.
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lrien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard. . .
. . . and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman. . .
. . . and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron. . .
. . . we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn
In the fires of Industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear. . .
. . . and the Iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march
within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.
-Burn it.
-Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those
who oppose us.
It will begin In Rohan.
Too long have these peasants
stood against you.
But no more.
othain! othain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says othain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord. . .
. . .is ready to fall.
Thodred.
Find the king's son!
-Mordor will pay for this.
-These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord omer, over here!
He's alive.
Thodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.
Grma.
Grma.
Grma.
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent. . .
. . .your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grma?
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, omer, son of omund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan. . .
. . .and all its domains
under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing. That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further. . .
. . . until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall. . .
. . .and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper. . .
. . .talk to each other. . .
. . .even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
-They look tasty.
-Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.
Just a mouthful. . .
. . .a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan. . .
. . .what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf. . .
. . .if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan
and of Thoden, your king.
Thoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king. . .
. . .and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say. . .
. . .as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends
captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel! Arod!
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.
